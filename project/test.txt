SACRAMENTO  —  Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday rejected Pacific Gas & Electric’s proposal to pull itself out of bankruptcy, saying its reorganization plan falls “woefully short” of safety requirements set under state law and demanding the company make major changes if it wants to access billions of dollars in a fund to pay wildfire claims.
The move complicates PG&E’s ability to remain in control of the company in a bankruptcy process that has seen financial interests vying to take over and local politicians preparing models for an entirely new utility. PG&E triggered the bankruptcy in January citing an estimated $30 billion in financial liabilities from California wildfires sparked by its equipment.

“In my judgment, the amended plan and the restructuring transactions do not result in a reorganized company positioned to provide safe, reliable, and affordable service to its customers, as required by AB 1054,” Newsom wrote in a letter to PG&E. “The state remains focused on meeting the needs of Californians including fair treatment of victims – not on which Wall Street financial interests fund an exit from bankruptcy.”

Newsom’s approval was not required under state law, but PG&E asked the governor to weigh in after reaching a $13.5-billion settlement with victims of some of California’s worst wildfires on record last week.

The request was a political gamble for the company, which gave Newsom and his team of advisors five days to review whether the proposal fulfilled the requirements of a new state law that allows utilities that meet certain requirements to dip into a fund to pay costs from California wildfires. Without access to the fund, Newsom said the company’s plan isn’t feasible.

PG&E pushed back and said it believes the plan conforms to requirements under state law. Jennifer Robison, a spokeswoman for the company, said PG&E was committed to working “diligently in the coming days to resolve any issues that may arise.” The company has until Tuesday to revise its proposal.

The request for the governor’s blessing forced Newsom to take a public position on the company’s reorganization long before state regulators perform an extensive review and must formally sign off on the PG&E proposal or a competing plan next year.

Rejecting the plan could risk delaying the bankruptcy process and payments to wildfire victims, said Jared Ellias, a bankruptcy law professor at UC Hastings.

“The company is kind of saying now, ‘You’re going to have to sign off on this,’” Ellias said. “‘We’re not going to let you have the benefit of distance from what we’re doing. If you say no, this thing could crash and burn, and you’re going to own the wreckage.’”

Richard Bridgford, an attorney who is part of a team representing wildfire victims, said the bankruptcy involves complex matters and balancing multiple interests.

“I’m hopeful that all the parties can move together to finally provide compensation for the victims who have suffered for over two years and experienced death, serious personal injury, loss of real and personal property and endured severe emotional distress, but in a manner that guarantees we avoid PG&E’s past mistakes and these fires — which is clearly where the governor is coming from,” he said.

In order to access the wildfire fund, Assembly Bill 1054 requires PG&E to exit bankruptcy by June 30, 2020, satisfy wildfire claims, preserve its efforts to meet the state’s climate goals and establish a governance structure that prioritizes safety.

Among his list of concerns, Newsom said the utility should have a new board of directors and a better financial model to ensure that ratepayers aren’t saddled with high rate increases to fund future safety investments.

“PG&E’s board of directors and management have a responsibility to immediately develop a feasible plan,” Newsom said. “Anything else is irresponsible, a breach of fiduciary duties, and a clear violation of the public trust.”

A UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll conducted last month for the Los Angeles Times shows Californians share Newsom’s concerns — fewer than 1 in 8 likely voters surveyed want PG&E to fix its own problems and maintain its current structure once it emerges from bankruptcy.

“We all know that we can’t trust PG&E to do the right thing or even follow the law,” state Sen. Bill Dodd (D-Napa) said. “We need to achieve systemic change in the structure and governance of PG&E to ensure safe, reliable power. The stakes for California are too high to leave it to PG&E executives and their narrow self-interests.”

Newsom has become a vocal critic of PG&E during his first year in office, taking the company to task in October as public anger swelled in Northern California over power shut-offs that left millions of customers in the dark for days on end. He has committed to increasing state oversight of the troubled company and has said the state’s ongoing intervention in the bankruptcy process would help ensure the utility that emerges from bankruptcy prioritizes safe, reliable and affordable service.

The governor held a news conference in early November and threatened to craft his own reorganization plan unless PG&E quickly reached settlement agreements with wildfire victims and other parties in the bankruptcy, and came up with a proposal that fulfilled the requirements of AB 1054. Newsom has charged his cabinet secretary Ana Matosantos to lead a task force to develop a state-backed proposal.
POWAY, Calif. —  A planned talk by Rep. Rashida Tlaib at the Westview High School theater has been canceled after the Poway Unified School District revoked its approval of the event, saying that the date of the talk is the only day the space can be cleaned before the holiday break.
Notice of the cancellation came late Thursday morning, a day after the San Diego County district had sent an email to the Center for American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) confirming use of the theater on Dec. 21 for the two-hour event titled Defending Our Communities, a Conversation with Rep. Rashida Tlaib. CAIR representatives had spoken with school officials about the event before it was originally approved and had applied via the district’s web portal.

On Wednesday, a letter was sent by a conservative legal fund to the Poway Unified superintendent and school board president suggesting that Tlaib’s presence and the event would be an insult to the Jewish community, which it said is still struggling to get over a shooting at the nearby Chabad of Poway synagogue last April that left one person dead and three wounded.

Daniel Piedra, executive director of the nonprofit Freedom of Conscience Defense Fund, said he was not told what prompted the district to cancel the event, but believes concerns expressed by his organization about “Tlaib’s anti-Israel rhetoric” played a role. The Defense Fund in 2017 represented plaintiffs suing to prohibit CAIR from teaching about Islam in the San Diego Unified School District’s anti-bullying program.

The fund was founded in 2012 by Rancho Santa Fe lawyer Charles LiMandri, who defended the Mount Soledad Cross in San Diego when challenged by the ACLU.

Tlaib, 43, a Democrat, was elected to represent Michigan’s 13th Congressional District last year. She is the first Palestinian American woman in Congress and, with Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress.

She has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration and has sharply criticized the Israeli government and called for an end to U.S. aid to Israel.

Tlaib is a member of the informal group of female Democrats in the House known as the Squad, along with Omar, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

Dustin Craun, executive director of the local chapter of CAIR, said Thursday afternoon he doesn’t believe in coincidences and thinks it’s highly possible the district made up an excuse to avoid controversy.

“I was told there was a conflict and the school needed it,” Craun said. “I said, ‘Well, that’s convenient.’ ”

“Now the congresswoman wants to speak to the superintendent, so obviously it’s pretty upsetting,” Craun said. Tlaib clearly has the right under the 1st Amendment to speak, he added.

The $65-a-person event will still be held that weekend, Craun said, when a suitable new venue can be found. Craun and UC San Diego political science professor Tom Wong are listed as participants in the conversation. Wong, a Democrat, is one of the candidates running to replace Rep. Susan Davis in the 53rd Congressional District.

A spokeswoman for the district said Thursday that the letter protesting Tlaib’s visit had nothing to do with the permit being denied. In fact, the spokeswoman, Christine Paik, said, Supt. Marian Kim-Phelps hasn’t even seen the letter.

“This time of year is crazy,” Paik said. “All of the holiday concerts and events are happening at our facilities. At that theater in particular, there is something scheduled every day through [Dec. 20],” she said.

She said Dec. 21 was the first and only time when scheduled maintenance of the building could be done before employees went home for the winter break.

“Sometimes facilities requests are approved without consulting the maintenance schedule, and that’s what happened in this case,” Paik said.

Tlaib could not be reached for comment.

Mohamed Salah scored twice as Premier League leaders Liverpool battled to victory over strugglers Watford in Nigel Pearson's first game in charge.

Salah curled the ball into the far corner for the opener before flicking in a late second in the final minute of normal time at Anfield.

Watford missed chances in both halves, while Liverpool's Sadio Mane had a header ruled out for offside following a review by the video assistant referee (VAR).

Liverpool remain unbeaten in the league this season while Watford are six points - and with a substantial goal difference to overturn - adrift of safety.

The Reds were made to work for their victory though - goalkeeper Alisson making smart saves after the break, while Watford's Ismaila Sarr also wasted a huge chance.

Salah squandered opportunities of his own too, but Liverpool did enough to pick up their 16th victory of the season and open up an 11-point gap at the top ahead of second-placed Leicester City, who face Norwich later on Saturday (15:00 GMT).

Liverpool grind out another win
It wasn't pretty, but once again Liverpool got the job done.

Jurgen Klopp's side have made Anfield a fortress and it was clear from the start that they were going to dominate possession and break Watford down.

A long ball over the top from Virgil van Dijk almost set Salah on his way within minutes of the starting whistle and Roberto Firmino could have scored shortly after, pouncing on a loose ball on the edge of the area.

But the chances were few for Liverpool in a first half that saw Watford defend in numbers and remain compact.

Watford had chances on the break but didn't take them - Will Hughes dragging a shot wide and Etienne Capoue having an effort blocked in the box.

In the end it was Liverpool who capitalised with a break of their own - Firmino, Mane and Salah combining for the opener.

Sarr missed a golden opportunity to equalise five minutes later, and Alisson was kept on his toes as he made two smart close-range saves early in the second half.

The Anfield crowd, who were frustrated at times by a lack of intensity and sloppiness, grew anxious as the game wore on - Van Dijk almost passing the ball into his own net following a mix up with Alisson and Trent Alexander-Arnold being caught out of possession on the right.

But the European champions, who are chasing a first league title in 30 years, were carrying winning momentum and victory here at Anfield leaves them heading into the new year with a healthy lead at the top of the table.

Organised but wasteful from Watford
Coming to Anfield in his first game in charge was always going to be a difficult task for Pearson, who replaced Quique Sanchez Flores as Watford boss earlier this month and was at Vicarage Road to see their 0-0 draw with Crystal Palace last week.

He was urging his side to remain tight and will have been pleased, on the whole, by their organisation at the back.

But Watford have not won in the league since 8 November - their only victory of the season - and they are the lowest-scoring side in the competition with just nine goals so far.

They had chances to score at Anfield - Sarr's fluffed attempt in the first half a huge miss, as he completely mishit a rebound from Gerard Deulofeu's dangerous cross.

Deulofeu, who got in behind a few times down the left, threw his arms up in frustration behind the goal as the Kop jeered before the ball had even gone out of play.

Those chances rarely come around again at Anfield but Deulofeu himself had one early in the second half, which he hit straight at Liverpool keeper Alisson.

Watford were never expected to take anything from this game but if they are to climb the table and get out of the relegation zone, they need to find their goal-scoring boots.

'It was not the prettiest game' - what the managers said
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp speaking to BT Sport: "It was not the prettiest game but I am more than happy with that. At this stage you have to show resilience and I believe we did that today. We have so many games but we are happy with this. Watford had their chances but we scored ours. We could have made the game easier for us but it's intense to be constantly in charge of the game. We have to defend with passion not organisation sometimes and that was sometimes now, right?"

Watford manager Nigel Pearson speaking to BT Sport: "It's always hard to come to places like this. There is a bit of risk and reward. We knew we would have to absorb pressure. The disappointment was their goal came from our set piece and that is something we need to address. I think we put them under strain and caused them problems but they have unbelievable players. We need to reflect on the performance and that going forwards will serve us well in the fight. I have seen more positives than negatives today. We have to make things happen and hopefully people have seen encouragement today."

Worrying times for Watford - the stats
Liverpool are unbeaten in 34 Premier League games (W29 D5), the third-longest run in the history of the competition after Arsenal (49) between May 2003-October 2004 and Chelsea (40) between October 2004-October 2005.
Watford's Nigel Pearson became the ninth manager to face Liverpool at Anfield in their first Premier League game in charge of a team - with all nine losing to the Reds by an aggregate score of 3-19.

Watford host Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday 22 December (14:00 GMT).
Shane Sutton's "hostile attitude" during doctor Richard Freeman's medical tribunal was because he was hiding the truth about testosterone being delivered to British Cycling in 2011, the hearing was told on Monday.

Former British Cycling performance director Sutton walked out of the tribunal last month after being accused of being "a liar, a doper and a bully" by Dr Freeman's defence lawyer Mary O'Rourke QC.

After a recording of that session from 12 November was replayed, she said he left the tribunal because it became "too hot to handle".

Highlighting where Sutton had raised his voice and banged the table, she told the hearing the Australian was "defensive" and "abusive".

"I got a hostile attitude because he knows the truth about what happened here," she said.

Former British Cycling and Team Sky doctor Freeman denies ordering testosterone gel to British Cycling headquarters in 2011 knowing or believing it was intended for an athlete.

He says he was bullied into ordering 30 sachets of Testogel by Sutton to treat erectile dysfunction, a claim the latter denies.

After Sutton left the hearing prematurely, O'Rourke said she wanted his evidence thrown out because it was incomplete, but on Friday it was deemed admissible.

O'Rourke is also attempting to have four of 22 charges against her client thrown out, claiming insufficient evidence.

In her submission she successfully asked for the audio of Sutton's curtailed appearance to be replayed before the tribunal in Manchester.

As part of that submission, she highlighted how Sutton's performance in the tribunal showed how he lacked "credibility".

"If you have nothing to hide you don't behave in that manner, you don't start becoming abusive and banging the table," she said.

"He fled before questions he knew were coming. He knew there was more material that would compromise him.

"He left because it was too hot to handle, not because of what I was saying."

The hearing was told on Friday that Sutton's perception had been that he had been bullied by O'Rourke, leading to him walking out.

But the tribunal panel clarified that they did not regard her conduct as bullying.

'He got caught out'
Following the replay of last month's stormy session, which lasted about 90 minutes, O'Rourke added: "A witness of truth doesn't behave in that way, a witness of truth doesn't misperceive he's bullied.

"A witness who has something to hide is going to be suspicious from the off.

"A witness who knows what he's done and told lies and knows well about drugs, and the use and abuse of them, is a witness who goes on the offensive.

"A witness of truth doesn't abuse counsel and Richard Freeman, who he calls a friend.

"He's come along with agenda. Is he a liar? Yes. He got caught out."

Earlier on Monday, O'Rourke told the hearing Dr Freeman did not attend on Monday after feeling "upset" by media reports of proceedings over the weekend.

During Friday's discussion of potential delays to the hearing, which mean it could continue after its scheduled end date of 20 December, O'Rourke said her client would not be able to attend the tribunal in the new year because he had been prescribed a skiing holiday by his own doctor.

That led to media coverage which "caused him some distress", O'Rourke said.

Dr Freeman has not attended the hearing since Sutton labelled him "spineless" during his appearance.

The independent tribunal has been called by the General Medical Council to assess Freeman's fitness to practise.

The medic, who left British Cycling in 2017, admits 18 of 22 charges against him including ordering testosterone to the National Cycling Centre, trying to cover up the order and lying to a UK Anti-Doping investigation.

The tribunal continues.
